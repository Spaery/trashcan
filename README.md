# Trashcan
Trashcan aims to provide a way to compactly dispose of unwanted junk items simply by renaming a chest.
The way it functions is you rename a chest put the items in it, then after closing it, it will clear the contents.
There is a built in safety mechanism in the way of a configurable timer for how long before the items are deleted from the chest.
The name to rename the chest to and how long before the contents get cleared are found in the plugin's config.yml file.
